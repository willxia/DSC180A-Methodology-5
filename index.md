**Section B18: NLP Credit Score Development**  
**Mentors:** Brian Duke and Berk Ustun

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic that has been covered so far was the using BERT to classify memo statements into bank transaction categories. 
It was an interesting problem and allowed for creative solutions. 
It was cool to see BERT doing its job and achieving a >95% accuracy.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
Although my Quarter 2 Project is most likely already determined (building a model to generate a cash score from bank transaction history), 
some interesting related projects could involve predicting other things, rather than just a cash score 
(which is basically the likelihood that someone defaults on a loan). 
For example, with business accounts, we could predict the likelihood that the business goes bankrupt.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
One change I could make is to try and explore different ways to create features and models rather than 
tunnel vision on just one or two. A lot of machine learning is just trial and error so having as many 
permutations of different factors is often the best approach to finding the best solution. 

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
One other technique that I'd be interested in is using a neural network for the classification problem. 
We used many complex models but I think it would be interesting to see how well a finely tuned neural network would perform.
